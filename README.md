## Computer-Simulated Participants in Equivalence Sorting Task

In this repository you will find two files:

| File Name | Description |
|---|---|
| SimParticipant.ipynb | This Jupyter notebook shows the outcome of an automated selection procedure in which computer-simulated participants select build equivalence groups based on trained relations, symmetry and adjacency (with these variables tuned to varying sensitivities). |
| KStimuli.R | This simple R code was used to illustrate the relationship of k (group size) and n (number of groups) versus the probability of selecting an adjacent stimulus. It is assumed that one stimulus is on the table and that a second has just been drawn. |
